block.gloomustry-blessing.details = A super-powerful unit created by enemies completely by accident. Her powerful projectiles are capable of causing tremendous damage and pose a great threat even to the strongest units.

block.gloomustry-plan1.details = It is recommended to use different walls for different types of units. \n Escar walls are capable of absorbing lasers and laser beams, they are better used against high-level mechs, as their projectiles are capable of emitting lasers after a collision. \n The rest of the walls without this ability with a lot of health are recommended to be used against spiders, since their projectiles are more powerful and penetrating, but they are not capable of emitting lasers.

block.gloomustry-plan2.details = If you thought that the more energy a generator produces, the better it is, then you are mistaken. \n\n The wastes generator is extremely useful on maps with a lot of distorted water. You can put one electric pump, and put two waste generators on the sides of it, so you get 70% of the energy. Such a scheme can be duplicated many times, but it is better to do it behind a flint. \n\n Solar panels, in turn, are very expensive, it is not recommended to make them the main source of energy. It is also not recommended to abuse vent generators, because you may run out of vents on the map and you will not be able to make oxygen.

block.gloomustry-plan3.details = It is recommended to move the ultragenion using liquid storage, as pipelines explode almost immediately if the ultragenion is in excess. \n\n At the middle stage of the game, it is advised not to waste amethyst on amethyst conveyors, it is better to carry kianit junctions, because they have almost the same speed, but they are cheaper, and if you want to direct the object in the other direction, then use a kianit underflow gate.

block.gloomustry-plan4.details = If you see a striped floor on the ground, then this is the core area where the core can be placed. \n\nIt is recommended to put a low-level core in such zones, as it is cheap, unlike others. \n\nIt is also advised to install cores whenever you see these zones, because extra space for resources as well as a longer retention of the sector will not hurt you.

block.gloomustry-plan5.details = If you have a large number of weak units coming at you, then use the PG-4 and the Gauss Turret, because their projectiles have good penetration and damage. \n\nThe diver, in turn, is good for destroying protected units, but weak against a large number of weak units. The blessing is excellent for destroying both protected units and a large number of weak ones, but it is very expensive. \n\nUse the interception tower to destroy enemy missiles before they damage your buildings.

block.gloomustry-plan6.details = If you doubt that you can break through the enemy defenses with your units, then arrange them in a large formation, or in a wide line, rather than gathering them all in a pile. This way, the enemy turret will only target one unit, not all of them at once. \n\nTry to save units and not waste them just like that, always if they have little health, then restore them with healing points or support mechs.

planet.gloomustry-tensarium.name = Tensar
planet.gloomustry-tensarium.description = [gray]A new planet has been discovered far from the solar system, which, like [violet]serpulo, [gray]has been infected, but on a larger scale. [red]crux [gray]decided to create a new race that will guard this planet - [green]epilios. [gray]The [green]Epilios, [gray]in turn, have created technologies that surpass the power of [red]crux technologies. [gray]However, this does not prevent you from getting another planet [orange]in your feed.


sector.gloomustry-quietlane.name = Quiet lane
sector.gloomustry-quietlane.description = A quiet little sector on the edge of the Tensarium. \n\n The low amount of resources and low enemy threat make this sector an ideal place to start capturing the planet.

sector.gloomustry-easternravines.name = Eastern ravines
sector.gloomustry-easternravines.description = Small areas of peat were formed in these narrow ravines. \n\n Start mining peat and make flint from it to create the initial energy. Explore new turrets. \n\n [red]Warning[]: Beware of enemy kamikazes, a large number of them can easily destroy your core.

announce.a = [green]\u26A0 THE ENEMIES ARE ADVANCING! \u26A0[]\n[lightgray] Immediately check the integrity of your defenses.
objective.a = [green]A big wave of enemies: [green]{0}[]
quietlanetext1 = [green]\u26A0A large reinforcement of enemies - [white]the last wave of the sector, \nwhich usually has more enemies than usual, and sometimes there are guardens.
quietlanetext2 = Welcome to the planet [#355E3FFF]Tensarium!\n\n []First, get some kianit.
quietlanetext3 = Explore the kianit drill and conveyor belt. \nThey will help you mine the ore and transfer it to the core.
quietlanetext4 = Now, get the tin.
quietlanetext5 = Now, extract the kianit and tin using drills \n and move them to the core.
quietlanetext6 = Explore the blocks written in the upper left corner of the screen.
quietlanetext7 = Place the manufacturer bullets \nand bring him a tin to create bullets for your turrets.
quietlanetext8 = Feed the turrets with ammo. Get ready to attack the enemies.
easternravinestext1 = Extract peat and explore the flint press, \n you will need it to create flint. \n\n Peat is indicated on the minimap.
easternravinestext2 = Bring peat to the flint press and \n start producing flint on it.
easternravinestext3 = Great, now explore the solar panel, \n it is needed to create power early in the game.
easternravinestext4 = The enemies are coming! Start building defenses. \n\n Look into the research tree, you can explore new turrets.
